### Chapter Three: The First Three Months {#chapter-three:-the-first-three-months}

The first three months will reveal which choices made in the first month were sound. By this time, many of the immediate dangers will have been addressed—there will be plans for water, basic shelter, and food acquisition. However-what separates those who merely survive from those who have a chance at rebuilding sustainable life-is structure.  
Groups will either become cohesive and organized, or they'll fragment under pressure. New power dynamics will shift neighborhoods into territories. Trade and barter will emerge in small, localized ways. People will start to specialize: someone becomes the water expert, another the mechanic, another the medic.  
This period is also when you must assess longer-term resources: will you stay in place and fortify? Will you move to seek better land? Do you have the skills and tools to farm, to repair, to hunt effectively?  
Important questions to answer in this timeframe:

-   Can your group sustain food production beyond scavenging?
-   Is your water supply reliable year-round?
-   Are you able to produce or repair critical tools?
-   Do you have a plan for winter (or other harsh weather) now that seasons will matter again?

Skills and division of labor are critical. If everyone in your group is capable of performing multiple roles, you've greatly increased resilience. Training others, cross-skilling, and documentation of important techniques (like water purification, fuel efficiency, and basic medical care) will increase group survivability.  
By three months, small communities may start to trade. Establishing fair trade practices, currency replacements (like bullets, batteries, or sugar), and clear rules for interaction will prevent conflicts. Keep in mind: trade brings both opportunity and risk; it introduces new people into your area and potential vectors for theft or violence.  
Security remains essential. Complacency kills. The more stable things seem, the more likely people are to let down their guard. Maintain watch rotations, quiet signals for danger, and redundancy in defenses. Consider relocating to a safer place only when necessary and when you have the resources to do so.  
This chapter will walk you through building resilience during the first three months: establishing production systems, defining roles, securing supply lines, and preparing for the next phase of survival and potential rebuilding.

## 2\. Group Roles and Responsibilities {#2.-group-roles-and-responsibilities}

An organized group is more than a pile of people. It is a system of roles, rules, and norms. In the first three months, you will transition from the ad-hoc organization of the first weeks to a stable structure that ensures food, water, security, and social cohesion.

Key roles to consider:

-   Leadership: a small council or single responsible person who makes and enforces decisions.
-   Scouts: people who can travel, gather supplies, and risk encounters.
-   Medics: basic medical care and infection control.
-   Security: defenders and those who train and maintain defensive strategies.
-   Craftsmen: people who repair tools, build shelters, and maintain vehicles or storage.

Having clear roles doesn't mean rigid hierarchy. It means everyone knows responsibilities and is accountable. Leadership must be adaptable, and rules must be enforceable.
